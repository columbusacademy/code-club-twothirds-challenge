<h1> 2/3rds of Average Challenge for Code Club!</h1>
<p1> Welcome code club 2022! The first challenge for this year is a simple (or maybe not so simple) game. Players simultaneously select a real number between 0 and 100, inclusive. The winner of the game is the player(s) who select a number closest to 2/3rds of the average of numbers chosen by all players.

This project comes with 4 template bots: AlwaysOne, ImitateWinner, RandomGuesser, and RandomUnderTwenty. For making your own bot you can duplicate one of these templates and delete the code inside of the methods or you can make a new class that implements strat (or if you haven't taken CS, just use the first method).

To test your bot go to the Play class, where you see all the bots being initialized initalize your bot in the same manner (so for example if I had a bot called my bot I would type: Strat player5 = new myBot();), then add your bot to players (for example typing players.add(player5);), finally run main and a display should pop up. 

Please put your name as the name of the bot (i.e. AlexanderNanda).

We also are offering for you to describe us a srategy (if you are unsure how to implement it) such as "pick the number 7 every time" or "use 2/3rds of the winner's guess last time."

If you have any questions at all please reach out to Alex (nandaa23@columbusacademy.org), Tiko (bdoyant23@columbusacademy.org), Cory (wuc24@.....) , Grace (luog23@....) , or Jim (phiefferj24@....)
